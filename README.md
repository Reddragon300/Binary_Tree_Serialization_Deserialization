# Binary Tree Serialization and Deserialization

This program provides a solution to the problem of serializing and deserializing a binary tree into a string representation. It allows you to convert a binary tree into a string and reconstruct the tree from that string.

## How to Use:
Follow the steps below to use the program:

1. Clone the repository or download the `binary_tree_serialization.py` file.

2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

3. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the `binary_tree_serialization.py` file.

4. Run the script using the command:
   ```css
   python binary_tree_serialization.py
   ```
5. The program will create a binary tree, serialize it, and then deserialize it.

6. The serialized tree will be printed, and the deserialized tree will be displayed as output.

## How It Works:

1. The `TreeNode` class is defined, representing a node in a binary tree. Each node contains a value, left child, and right child.

2. The `serialize` function is implemented. It serializes a binary tree by performing a preorder traversal. The function returns a string representation of the tree, where nodes are separated by commas.

3. The `deserialize` function is implemented. It reconstructs a binary tree from a serialized string representation. The function recursively builds the tree by splitting the string into node values and using a preorder traversal approach.

4. In the testing section, a sample binary tree is created for demonstration purposes.

5. The tree is serialized using the `serialize` function, and the serialized string is printed.

6. The serialized string is then passed to the `deserialize` function to reconstruct the tree.

7. The deserialized tree is printed as output.

## Example Output:
  ```python
  Serializing node with value: 1
  Serializing node with value: 2
  Serializing node with value: 3
  Serializing node with value: 4
  Serializing node with value: 5
  Serialized tree: 1,2,None,None,3,4,None,None,5,None,None

  Deserializing node with value: 1
  Deserializing node with value: 2
  Deserializing node with value: 3
  Deserializing node with value: 4
  Deserializing node with value: 5
  Deserialized tree: <TreeNode object at 0x00000123ABCDEF>
  ```

## Conclusion:

The program successfully serializes a binary tree into a string representation and deserializes the string back into a binary tree. You can use this code to solve similar problems or integrate it into other applications that require binary tree serialization and deserialization functionality.

Feel free to explore the code and modify it according to your requirements!
